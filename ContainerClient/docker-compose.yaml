          ## Volumes here are local directories which are mounted onto your container
          ##     nothing is copied, they are the same file and changes on either the
          ##     host or container will be present on the other (and will persist).
          ##     the general format is "- <path/on/your/host>:<path/in/container>"
          ##     The host paths are the default/suggested locations, but you can place
          ##     files in other locations and update these paths. If you cange the
          ##     container paths then your files may not be found by our software.
